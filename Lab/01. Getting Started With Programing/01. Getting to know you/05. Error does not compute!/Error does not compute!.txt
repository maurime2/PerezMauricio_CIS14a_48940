Error: does not compute!
There are some things you can't do in the console. Computers only speak certain languages, like the one you've been using today: JavaScript!

If you use words that aren't in the JavaScript language, it will get confused and give you an error.

Instructions
Try to confuse the interpreter by using a word it doesn't know, like eggplant. It will give you a ReferenceError.
