Substrings
We've learned a few ways to manipulate numbers. What about manipulating strings?

Sometimes you don't want to display the entire string, just a part of it. For example, in your Gmail inbox, you can set it to display the first 50 or so characters of each message so you can preview them. This preview is a substring of the original string (the entire message).

Code:

"some word".substring(x, y) where x is where you start chopping and y is where you finish chopping the original string.

The number part is a little strange. To select for the "he" in "hello", you would write this:

"hello". substring(0, 2);
Each character in a string is numbered starting from 0, like this:

0 1 2 3 4
 | | | | | 
 h e l l o
The letter h is in position 0, the letter e is in position 1, and so on.

Therefore if you start at position 0, and slice right up till position 2, you are left with just he

More examples:

1. First 3 letters of "Batman"
"Batman".substring(0,3);

2. From 4th to 6th letter of "laptop"
"laptop".substring(3,6);

Instructions
Find the 4th up to and including the 7th letter of the string "wonderful day".
