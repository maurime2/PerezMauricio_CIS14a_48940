More Variable Practice
We have seen how to create a variable. But how do we use it? It is useful to think that any time you type the variable's name, you are asking the computer to swap out the variable name and swap in the value of the variable.

For example:

var myName = "Steve Jobs";

myName.substring(0,5)

Look at the second line above. You have asked the computer to swap out myName and swap in Steve Jobs, so

myName.substring(0,5)

becomes

"Steve Jobs".substring(0,5)

which evaluates to Steve.

Another example

var myAge = 120;

What is

myAge % 12 ? See the hint to check your answer.

So the variable stores the value of the variable, whether that is a number or a string. As you will see soon, this makes writing long programs much easier!
