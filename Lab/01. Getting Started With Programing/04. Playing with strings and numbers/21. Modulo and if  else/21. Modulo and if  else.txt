Modulo and if / else
So why learn modulo? For one thing, it's good at testing divisibility. Consider 30 % 10. What does it return? There is nothing left over, so 0.

How about 9 % 3? Also 0.

We can use modulos in comparisons, like this:

10 % 2 === 0 evaluates to true
7 % 3 === 0 evaluates to false because there is 1 left over.
Instructions
Let's get the if/else" statement to display "The first number is even".

Edit line 5 by adding a comparison that evaluates to true.
In the comparison, use a modulo and an even number, like we did in the example above.
