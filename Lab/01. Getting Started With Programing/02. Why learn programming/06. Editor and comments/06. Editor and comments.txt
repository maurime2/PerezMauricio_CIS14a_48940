Editor and comments
So far we've been writing lines of code in the editor. Now we see two lines that start with //.

The // sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.

Instructions
The computer will ignore the code on lines 1-2, since it is commented out.

On line 3, find the length of the word "cake".
