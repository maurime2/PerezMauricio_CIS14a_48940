Using console.log
You may have noticed that the interpreter doesn't print out every single thing it does. So if we want to know what it's thinking, we sometimes have to ask it to speak to us.

console.log() will take whatever is inside the parentheses and log it to the console below your code—that's why it's called console.log()!

This is commonly called printing out.

Instructions
Please print the following two console.log statements at the same time. Type one on line 1 and the other on line 2. Then press Save & Submit Code.

console.log(2 * 5)
console.log("Hello")
