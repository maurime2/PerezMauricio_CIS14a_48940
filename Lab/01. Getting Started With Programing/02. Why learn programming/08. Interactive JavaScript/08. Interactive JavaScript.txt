Interactive JavaScript
What we just saw was a fun example of how JavaScript can be interactive. Try it yourself!

Examples:

confirm("I feel awesome!");
confirm("I am ready to go.");

These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users. You've probably seen them pop up when you try to delete important things or leave a website with unsaved changes.

Instructions
Write your own message that you want the user to confirm.
