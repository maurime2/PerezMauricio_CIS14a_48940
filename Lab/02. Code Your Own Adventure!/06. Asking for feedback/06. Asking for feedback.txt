Asking for feedback
It is worthwhile asking your user for feedback!

Instructions
Create a variable called feedback and prompt the user to rate your game out of 10.

If feedback is greater than 8, print out: "Thank you! We should race at the next concert!"

Otherwise, print out:
"I'll keep practicing coding and racing."
