What is programming?
Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so it can do cool stuff with your information.

Programs can't yet make your bed, but they can do math, keep track of your bank account, or send a message to a friend.

To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a prompt.

Examples:

1. prompt("What is your name?");
2. prompt("What is Ubuntu?");

Instructions
Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this!
