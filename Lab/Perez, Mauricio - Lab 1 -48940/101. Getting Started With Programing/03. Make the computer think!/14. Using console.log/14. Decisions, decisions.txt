Decisions, decisions
Nice work on comparisons! Now let's see how we can use comparisons to ask yes or no questions.

Say we want to write a program that asks whether your name is longer than 7 letters. If the answer is yes, we can respond with "You have a long name!" We can do this with an if statement:

if( "myName".length >= 7 ) {
    console.log("You have a long name!");
}
An if statement is made up of the if keyword, a condition like we've seen before, and a pair of curly braces { }. If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run.

Instructions
Check out the if statement in the editor.

On line 1, add a condition inside the parentheses ( ).
If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run. So on line 2, use console.log to print out a string.
