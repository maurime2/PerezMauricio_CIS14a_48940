Conclusion: Part 2
Congratulations on making it this far. You have learned a lot! Just one more exercise before a big pat on the back!

The last tricky thing we learned was about if / else statements.

If / else statements are conditional statements. Under different conditions, the computer will output different things.

Instructions
Write your own if / else statement.
The only instruction is that the result of evaluating the statement is a log to the console of "I finished my first course!".
