So far, we've seen
a. how to create a variable
b. how to use a variable

Let's now see how to change a variable's value. A variable's value is easily changed. Just pretend you are creating a new variable while using the same name of the existing variable!

var myAge = "Thirty";
Say I had a birthday and I want to change my age.
myAge = "Thirty-one";

Now the value of myAge is "Thirty-one"!
