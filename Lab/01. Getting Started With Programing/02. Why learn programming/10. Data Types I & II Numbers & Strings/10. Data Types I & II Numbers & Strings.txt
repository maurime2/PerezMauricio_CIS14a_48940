Data Types I & II: Numbers & Strings
Data comes in various types. You have used two already!

a. numbers are quantities, just like you're used to. You can do math with them.

b. strings are sequences of characters, like the letters a-z, spaces, and even numbers. These are all strings: "Ryan", "4" and "What is your name?" Strings are extremely useful as labels, names, and content for your programs.

To make a number in your code, just write a number as numerals without quotes: 42, 190.12334.

To write a string, surround words with quotes: "What is your name?"

Instructions
Write a string with at least 3 words. Check out the examples of strings above.
Find the length of the string by writing a period (full stop) and the word length, like this:

"string".length
Length counts every character in the string - including spaces!
