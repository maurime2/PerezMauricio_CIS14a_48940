Computers are smart
Great! We used an if statement to do something if the answer to the condition was yes, or true as we say in JavaScript.

In addition to doing something when the condition is true, we can do something else if the condition is false. For example, if your name is shorter than 7 letters, we can respond with "You have a short name!" We can do this using an if / else statement:

if( "myName".length >= 7 ) {
    console.log("You have a long name!");
}
else {
    console.log("You have a short name!");  
}
Just like before, if the condition is true, then only the code inside the first pair of curly braces will run. Otherwise, the condition is false, so only the code inside the second pair of curly braces after the else keyword will run.

In the example above the condition "myName".length >= 7 evaluates to false since "myName" only has 6 letters. Since the condition is false, only the code inside the curly braces after the else keyword runs, and prints out You have a short name!.

Instructions
In line 1, fill in a condition that will evaluate to false
Fill in some code to run in the else portion (this will run if the condition is false). Use console.log for this part.
