Mid-lesson breather
We've covered a lot of ground so far! So many new terms, so much syntax. Let's take a breather and review. We have learned:

1. Confirm and prompt

We can make pop-up boxes appear! 
confirm("I am ok");
prompt("Are you ok?");

2. Data types

a. numbers (e.g. 4.3, 134)

b. strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!", "JavaScript expert")

c. booleans (e.g. false, 5 > 4)

3. Conditionals

If the first condition is met, execute the first code block. If it is not met, execute the code in the else block. See the code on the right for another example.
