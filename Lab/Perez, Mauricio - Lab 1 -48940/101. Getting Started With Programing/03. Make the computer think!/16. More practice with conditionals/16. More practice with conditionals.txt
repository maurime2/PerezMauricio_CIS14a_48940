More practice with conditionals
Now let's practice using if/else statements. Do as much as you can by yourself, but if you need a reminder, click the "Stuck? Get a hint!" button below.

Instructions
Write an if/else statement, just like we did in the last exercise. Here's what the outline of the code looked like:

if (condition) 
{
    // if condition is true
    // do this code
}
else // "otherwise"
{
    // do this code instead
}
If your condition is true, use console.log to print "The condition is true".

Otherwise (else) when it is false, use console.log to print "The condition is false".

Make sure your condition evaluates to false, so that your program prints out "The condition is false".
