Data Type III: Booleans
Nice job! Next let's look at booleans. A boolean is either true or false.

For example, comparing two numbers returns a true or false result:

23 > 10 is true
5 < 4 is false
Instructions
Let's compare two numbers to return a true result:

First, write the string "I'm coding like a champ"
Next, find the length of the string using .length
Then, compare the string's length to see if it is greater than 10
