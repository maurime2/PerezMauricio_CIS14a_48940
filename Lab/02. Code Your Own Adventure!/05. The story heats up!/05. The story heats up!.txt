The story heats up!
Now you have to create different scenarios. Good thing we know how to do that using if / else statements.

If userAnswer is "yes", print out: "You and Bieber start racing. It's neck and neck! You win by a shoelace!"

Otherwise, print out: "Oh no! Bieber shakes his head and sings 'I set a pace, so I can race without pacing.'"

Remember: = is for assignment, and === is to check if things are equal!

Instructions
Use an if / else statement to write out the last part of this game!

Make sure to check the console for error messages and suggestions for how to fix them.
