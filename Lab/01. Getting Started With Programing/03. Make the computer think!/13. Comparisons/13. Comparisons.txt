Comparisons
So far we've learned about three data types:

strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!")
numbers (e.g. 4, 10)
booleans (e.g. false, 5 > 4)
Now let's learn more about comparison operators.

List of comparison operators:

> Greater than
< Less than
<= Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
=== Equal to
!== Not equal to
Instructions

Choose the correct comparison operator to make each of the four statements print out true.
